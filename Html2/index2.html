            <p><strong style="color:green"><u>Suresh Raina</strong></u> represented the new-age Indian cricketer: An attacking<del> left-hander</del> who went for the big shots with impunity and cleared the field with a flourish when at the top of his game, he was also an<strong> electric fielder</strong>strong in the circle. All of this, though, was tempered with an iffy technique against the short ball, which was exploited mercilessly in Test cricket and meant Raina's Test career never reached the heights his limited-overs career did, despite starting promisingly.

                Raina was prodigious at the under-19 level, his run-scoring and a string of double-hundreds taking him to the Indian junior team and beyond it, to India colours. It took Raina five years to cement his place as an India regular, moving from being a limited-overs specialist who played 98 ODIs to one who became the 12th Indian to make a Test century on debut.</p>
                <p>Raina was firmly associated with Chennai Super Kings, though, and with his captain MS Dhoni; their close relationship even earned him the <u>nickname 'Chinna Thala' (junior leader)</u> to Dhoni's 'Thala'</p>
